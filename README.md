## Fab Lab @ MESCE

 The Kerala Startup mission is setting up Fab Labs in the state in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Centre of Bits and Atoms. [Dr Neil Gershenfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gershenfeld), director of the MIT Centre for Bits and Atoms pioneered the concept of fab lab.Fab Labs (Fabrication Laboratories) are facilities where people with minimal training can design and manufacture any product using advanced manufacturing machines linked to a computer. 
  Fab Lab @ MESCE , Kuttippuram is the only fab lab in the Malabar Zone . A training session was conducted for the students of the college from 2nd August 2017 to 17th August 2107 inorder to make us familirized with the machines and to help us explore about new technologies .
